It was around this time that we got Internet in our household, and I wanted to create a custom website for my artworks, because I found deviantART lame. So I started looking into how websites are made, and ended up cobbling together a basic PHP page on a free hosting provider. I was fascinated by web programming, so I decided that I would go on to get a software engineering degree, but I still considered graphic design and illustration my main forte. The first class on the first day of university was Introduction to Linear Algebra, which started with matrices, determinants and Gauss-Jordan elimination.

Here\u0026#x27;s a list of some, as I see them.\u003cp\u003e- proprietary, and even if Berkeley could fork out millions for a license, that wouldn\u0026#x27;t allow other people to use work Berkeley published. That eliminated at least x86, ARM, MIPS, 64 bit SPARC, POWER (at the time).\u003cp\u003e- features that are just bad ideas: register windows, delay slots that made the first implementation easier but are just useless cruft once you go superscalar or even have different cache or branch latencies, or branch prediction etc.\u003cp\u003e- no existing or clear path to 64 bit. RISC-V was 64-bit first, with 32 bit as an option. ARM and OpenRISC were 32 bit only. They have both since got 64 bit, ARM with an entirely new ISA. Only 32 bit SPARC was open.\u003cp\u003e- opcode space already full, or nearly so. RISC-V was always planned to support many extensions far into the future, many of which can\u0026#x27;t even be conceived of in 2010 (or 2022 for that matter), and they need opcode space. OpenRISC for example is a pretty good \u0026quot;state of the art\u0026quot; ISA in 2010, with all the features commercial ISAs have, but the opcode space is full.\u003cp\u003e- inappropriate license, even if open. GPL is acceptable for an intermediate tool such as GCC, where the output it produces is not GPL. Though even then, almost all new work has switched to LLVM for quite a few years already (other things play a part in that too: source code understandability, upstreaming policy...). Berkeley has long preferred more permissive licences.\u003cp\u003e- poor code density. Not as important as legal issues, but still desirable. Disk and RAM are huge now and not an issue, but L1 icache has grown very little in 30 years. Cache latency and energy expended in instruction fetch have become more and more important. Extremely variable instruction lengths are difficult to deal with, but two lengths with a clear marker of the length adds very little burden to instruction decoding and has a long history, from CDC 6600 in 1964 with 15 and 30 bit instruction lengths (the fastest supercomputer of its time, and effectively a RISC), to the Cray 1 (16 and 32 bit instruction lengths), to the IBM 801, the RISC I. ARM became dominant in mobile in large part due to the high performance but dense code of Thumb2. 8086 had great code density. i386 lost density with 32 bit literals and offsets, and addr16 and data16 prefixes to override them. Amd64 lost even more density -- though still better than the fixed length 32 bit instructions in RISC ISAs such as SPARC, MIPS, POWER, and original ARM. ARM did a great job getting fixed-length arm64 about as dense as amd64 by managing to combine two operations into single instructions in ways that are used frequently enough in real programs to matter. But not as dense as Thumb2 or RISC-V.\u003cp\u003e- no support for subsets. Not important in smartphones, desktop, servers at least for the main CPU. But extremely useful for embedded applications, INCLUDING the dozens of small secondary CPU cores doing management functions in a desktop SoC. It\u0026#x27;s extremely useful to be able to use the same basic ISA, and more importantly the same toolchain, for those secondary cores. Historically many ISAs have made floating point or SIMD optional. Mostly because they started without them. But both amd64 and arm64 drew a line in the sand and said FP and SIMD are part of the baseline. Which makes sense for big applications processors, but is severely limiting if you want to get into embedded uses. RISC-V does similar with the applications processor profile, a convention, not a hard limitation.\u003cp\u003eThat was in 2010.  Since then some other ISAs have gone \u0026quot;open\u0026quot;, perhaps in reaction to RISC-V. But how open are they really? Are they irreversibly open?\u003cp\u003eMIPS supposedly went open for a subset of their ISAs in May 2019 (not even the most interesting and modern NanoMIPS), then abruptly closed again in October 2019, only five months later. And they weren\u0026#x27;t particularly open. You had to get your business plans approved by MIPS before they would give you a license, you had to get your core tested and approved by MIPS, and you were not allowed to publish your core e.g. on github. And in any case it\u0026#x27;s not BETTER than RISC-V. At most it\u0026#x27;s about the same.\u003cp\u003ePOWER is apparently open now. I don\u0026#x27;t even know exactly what they mean by that. I used PowerPC for 10 or 12 years and liked it (did assembly language programming on it etc), but it\u0026#x27;s not better than RISC-V.\u003cp\u003eIf some of these things had been properly open in 2010 then RISC-V might never have been started. But once all the work has ALREADY been done to design RISC-V, design chips, port software such as GCC and LLVM and Linux and everything else? And RISC-V momentum is snowballing? And they others are not technically better anyway?\u003cp\u003eToo late, guys.","parent":"33120470"}

Normally, a string of characters is represented using a fixed number of bits per character, as in the ASCII code. When a string is converted to arithmetic encoding, frequently used characters will be stored with fewer bits and not-so-frequently occurring characters will be stored with more bits, resulting in fewer bits used in total. Arithmetic coding differs from other forms of entropy encoding, such as Huffman coding, in that rather than separating the input into component symbols and replacing each with a code, arithmetic coding encodes the entire message into a single number, an arbitrary-precision fraction q, where 0.0 ≤ q \u0026lt; 1.0. It represents the current information as a range, defined by two numbers.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org\u0026#x2F;wiki\u0026#x2F;Arithmetic_coding\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org\u0026#x2F;wiki\u0026#x2F;Arithmetic_coding\u003c/a\u003e","parent":"33132336"}

Our product is a more flexible, simple way to manage all your data tools alerts.\u003cp\u003eWe know you live in Slack like we do. We built Atalert as unified alert platform in the form of a Slack bot. In 7 clicks, you can be ready to send your first alert. Whether you want markdown, text, attachments, or DBT logs, Atalert handles your alert and routes it to right person.\u003cp\u003eThere’s two types of people that get the most value out of Atalert:\u003cp\u003e1. The developer that owns data infrastructure at their company, and wants to lighten the load through automation.\n2. The non-technical marketer\u0026#x2F;customer success\u0026#x2F;PM (or founder!) that makes use of data tools that publish customer data such as a BI tool, CRM, or any tool that can send a web-hook.\u003cp\u003eLet’s say you want to track if your DBT or Airflow job finished successfully. Or you want to track if a new customer signed up for a trial and was captured in your CRM. First, you have to write code to collect and log each behavior that you want to track. Then you have to send it by email or create a custom Slack bot to tell you.\u003cp\u003eThis requires engineering effort, and it’s distracting to maintain. If you didn’t track something or made a mistake, that data is lost forever.\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#x27;m confident if you are a developer that you are tired of non-core product work, tasks that the PM or marketer don\u0026#x27;t see as adding value. Think of this from a marketers\u0026#x2F;PM\u0026#x27;s shoes: they are slowed or blocked from their work, and have to distract developers to get unblocked, to simply send an alert.\u003cp\u003eThis is painful for multiple teams. I dealt with this over the last 4 years of doing data consulting at [Atadataco.com](\u003ca href=\"http:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;atadataco.com\u0026#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;atadataco.com\u0026#x2F;\u003c/a\u003e).

This is supplied by a central server that acts as a public key repository and message relay\u0026#x2F;store.

This is also the start of some form of key exchange in the hopes of switching to symmetric encryption for future communication.\u003cp\u003eI see problems with this setup. The central server is responsible for relaying communication since there is no directly link between those trying to communicate. It is also responsible for handing out public keys.

If some scientist somewhere chops words and slices definitions and does some measurements and declares that my \u0026quot;self\u0026quot; isn\u0026#x27;t what is \u0026quot;making decisions\u0026quot;, then they\u0026#x27;ve been misled by bad philosophy into making stupid statements. And I use the word \u0026quot;stupid\u0026quot; carefully.\u003cp\u003eI am completely unfazed by the fact that what I intuitively thought the process might have been isn\u0026#x27;t the real process. The entire history of science from start to finish has been the unrelenting story of taking a closer look at something than we ever have before, and being surprised by what we found. The exceptions to that, such as predicting antimatter or the Higg\u0026#x27;s boson, are notable stories precisely because they are exceptions. Nevertheless, those surprises never negate our previous experiences. They reveal unexpected sources and surprising nuances, but the fact that we were surprised by where our higher-level concepts came from reveal that our previous understanding was in error, not the higher level concepts. Water has been wet for the whole of human experience, no matter whether it was its own element, or a essence, or a composition of atoms, or a pattern of fluctuations in quantum fields, or whatever the final Grand Unified Theory might declare it \u0026quot;really\u0026quot; is. Our understanding of water has been greatly enhanced by those advances, but it remains wet.\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, my self is whatever is making decisions. The only way to break me off that definition would be to remove the entire \u0026quot;making decisions\u0026quot; part, which gets into its own philosophical thicket. Even in a fully deterministic universe I may still be \u0026quot;making decisions\u0026quot;, despite popular belief to the contrary; one must simply be more careful about the definition of \u0026quot;making decisions\u0026quot; but meaningful definitions can still be produced.\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#x27;s a very long history of this sort of word chopping. Declaring this or that thing an \u0026quot;illusion\u0026quot; simply because it isn\u0026#x27;t exactly what we thought it was, or because it turns out not to be an atomic object of its own in the universe (hardly surprising since the only atomic things that seem to actually exist in this universe aren\u0026#x27;t very philosophically exciting, like quarks and electrons) is one very common tell, but it\u0026#x27;s not the only one. Consciousness gets a lot of stories like this where someone tries to manipulate words to \u0026quot;reveal\u0026quot; conscious experience is some sort of fake or something, but amazingly, not a single one of them has affected my own personal conscious experience. Per Descartes, as the existence of my own conscious experience is arguably \u003ci\u003ethe\u003c/i\u003e single thing I have the most confidence about, arguably the only thing I am \u003ci\u003e100%\u003c/i\u003e certain of, I find myself rather unimpressed with attempts to deny it. The fact that a certain subset of scientists are perturbed by their inability to wrap numbers around it is their problem, not mine. They are welcome to try to explain it; any attempts they make to explain it \u003ci\u003eaway\u003c/i\u003e can be discarded without further examination.","parent":"33340457"}

And you think Russia didn\u0026#x27;t understand that Ukraine was not going to be accepted any time soon?\u003cp\u003eThat would be the case if NATO adhered to the letter of its own laws\u0026#x2F;documents\u0026#x2F;policies. But I think the Russians don\u0026#x27;t consider that possibility as something they want to bet their future on. It would mean putting the future safety of the Russian State entirely in the benevolent hands of NATO decision-makers. I think after the 2007 ABM dispute, any perception of NATO benevolence in Putin\u0026#x27;s mind was shattered. Maybe we\u0026#x27;ll carve out a special exception for Ukraine. Maybe we\u0026#x27;ll re-write NATO\u0026#x27;s Articles to remove the \u0026quot;no existing territorial disputes\u0026quot; clause. Or maybe the US would just bully\u0026#x2F;bribe every other member into voting \u0026quot;Yes\u0026quot; to Ukraine. These sound unbelievable to most Westerners, but they are probably all realistic risks in the brain of a KGB field agent. So after Ukraine\u0026#x27;s constitutional amendment in 2019 [9], Putin probably decided to seize the initiative. If he spent a few months figuring out exactly how to respond, that would put him Summer-Fall of 2019....planning to execute an early 2020 full annexation. Then COVID hit, and Putin waited until the global pandemic was stabilized before setting in motion staging his troops for invasion (Fall 2021 with a planned January invasion)...then he had to delay AGAIN after Big Daddy Xi told him \u0026quot;Don\u0026#x27;t fuck up my Olympics with your war.\u0026quot; So world events may have delayed a Spring 2020 invasion until Spring 2022, which means we\u0026#x27;re actually witnessing the fastest possible turn-around time for a Russian offensive, assuming Ukraine\u0026#x27;s amendment was the straw that broke the camel\u0026#x27;s back. It also means Putin may have planned an invasion while notoriously-anti-interventionist Trump was in office, but ended up getting puppet-on-warmonger-strings Biden in the White House by the time everything was ready. \u003ci\u003eshrug\u003c/i\u003e Entirely supposition on my part.\u003cp\u003e[1] \u003ca href=\"https:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;www.newyorker.com\u0026#x2F;news\u0026#x2F;daily-comment\u0026#x2F;russia-and-china-unveil-a-pact-against-america-and-the-west\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;www.newyorker.com\u0026#x2F;news\u0026#x2F;daily-comment\u0026#x2F;russia-and-chin...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003e[2] \u003ca href=\"https:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;jamestown.org\u0026#x2F;program\u0026#x2F;russia-and-china-a-mutually-exaggerated-strategic-partnership\u0026#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;jamestown.org\u0026#x2F;program\u0026#x2F;russia-and-china-a-mutually-ex...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003e[3] \u003ca href=\"https:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;www.politico.com\u0026#x2F;magazine\u0026#x2F;story\u0026#x2F;2015\u0026#x2F;11\u0026#x2F;pentagon-fight-over-russia-213316\u0026#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;www.politico.com\u0026#x2F;magazine\u0026#x2F;story\u0026#x2F;2015\u0026#x2F;11\u0026#x2F;pentagon-fig...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003e[4] \u003ca href=\"https:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;warontherocks.com\u0026#x2F;2016\u0026#x2F;05\u0026#x2F;fixing-nato-deterrence-in-the-east-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-natos-crushing-defeat-by-russia\u0026#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;warontherocks.com\u0026#x2F;2016\u0026#x2F;05\u0026#x2F;fixing-nato-deterrence-in-...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003e[5] \u003ca href=\"https:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;www.theamericanconservative.com\u0026#x2F;facing-the-facts-of-war-with-russia\u0026#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;www.theamericanconservative.com\u0026#x2F;facing-the-facts-of-...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003e[6] \u003ca href=\"https:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;medium.com\u0026#x2F;war-is-boring\u0026#x2F;fd-how-the-u-s-and-its-allies-got-stuck-with-the-worlds-worst-new-warplane-5c95d45f86a5\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;medium.com\u0026#x2F;war-is-boring\u0026#x2F;fd-how-the-u-s-and-its-alli...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003e[7] \u003ca href=\"http:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;iskra-news.info\u0026#x2F;news\u0026#x2F;segodnja_nochju_iz_borispolja_v_ssha_strartoval_samoljot_s_zolotym_zapasom_ukrainy\u0026#x2F;2014-03-07-9122\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;iskra-news.info\u0026#x2F;news\u0026#x2F;segodnja_nochju_iz_borispolja_v_...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003e[8] \u003ca href=\"https:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;www.globalresearch.ca\u0026#x2F;libya-all-about-oil-or-all-about-banking\u0026#x2F;24306\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;www.globalresearch.ca\u0026#x2F;libya-all-about-oil-or-all-abo...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003e[9] \u003ca href=\"https:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;www.rferl.org\u0026#x2F;a\u0026#x2F;ukraine-president-signs-constitutional-amendment-on-nato-eu-membership\u0026#x2F;29779430.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;www.rferl.org\u0026#x2F;a\u0026#x2F;ukraine-president-signs-constitution...\u003c/a\u003e","parent":"33355179"}
